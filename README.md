# Spring-Rest

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide for building a REST web service using the Spring framework.

Prerequisites:

Eclipse IDE (Mars release)
Java 1.8
Apache Tomcat 8

After deploying the code on Apache use below url to hit
http://localhost:8080/SpringRest/rest/request/pay?key=SHARED_KEY

Above lin will not work if you directly fire from browser as service only accept POST method, hence either you have to modify the code to make request method as GET or use POSTMAN app to hit url with POST method
